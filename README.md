# Multi-Framework Portfolio
This repository contains my **personal portfolio project**, developed using multiple frontend frameworks and technologies.  
The goal is to demonstrate my ability to design and implement the same concept across different ecosystems, including:

- **Jetpack Compose for Desktop** (Kotlin)
- **React** (TypeScript)
- **Angular** (TypeScript)

Each version highlights my adaptability, design consistency, and understanding of UI/UX principles across frameworks.

## 🪐 Project Description

This project is an evolving portfolio intended to showcase my skills, projects, and technical growth.  
It serves both as a personal showcase and a playground to experiment with modern frontend technologies.
