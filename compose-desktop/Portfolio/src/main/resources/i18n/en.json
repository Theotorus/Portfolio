Players connect to a local Spring Boot server via an Android app. Each player is assigned a role — impostor or crewmate — and must interact with their physical environment. QR codes placed around the location act as interaction points: players scan them to perform actions, complete missions, or trigger emergency meetings. Almost all in-game actions rely on these codes, creating an immersive experience blending social gameplay with real-world movement.",
